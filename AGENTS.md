# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This is a Vite + React + TypeScript project with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.

- `src/main.tsx` boots the app, `src/App.tsx` is the root component.
- `src/pages/` contains route-level views (e.g., `Index.tsx`, `NotFound.tsx`).
- `src/components/` holds shared UI and feature components. Base UI primitives live under `src/components/ui/`.
- `src/hooks/` contains reusable hooks (e.g., `use-mobile.tsx`, `use-toast.ts`).
- `src/data/` stores local data modules.
- `src/lib/` contains utilities (e.g., `utils.ts`).
- Tests live in `src/test/`, with setup in `src/test/setup.ts`.
- Static assets are in `public/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use the npm scripts defined in `package.json`:

- `npm run dev`: start the local dev server with Vite.
- `npm run build`: create a production build.
- `npm run build:dev`: create a development-mode build.
- `npm run preview`: serve the production build locally.
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint on the codebase.
- `npm run test`: run Vitest in CI mode.
- `npm run test:watch`: run Vitest in watch mode.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript + React with JSX in `.tsx` files.
- Indentation: follow existing formatting in the touched file; no formatter is configured.
- Components are PascalCase (e.g., `Header.tsx`, `CaseModal.tsx`).
- Hooks are `use-` prefixed and camelCase (e.g., `useInView.ts`, `use-mobile.tsx`).
- Utilities are lower camel or kebab as currently used (e.g., `utils.ts`).
- ESLint rules live in `eslint.config.js`; run `npm run lint` before pushing.

## Testing Guidelines
- Test runner: Vitest with `jsdom` environment.
- Test files match `src/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}`.
- Place common setup in `src/test/setup.ts`.
- Prefer descriptive test names: `ComponentName.test.tsx` or `feature.spec.ts`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commit conventions are not defined in this repository (no Git history available here). Use clear, imperative messages like `Add hero section animations`.
- PRs should include:
  - A concise summary of changes and reasoning.
  - Steps to test locally (commands or manual steps).
  - Screenshots or short clips for UI changes.

## Configuration Notes
- Module alias: `@` maps to `src` (see `vitest.config.ts` and Vite config).
- Tailwind config lives in `tailwind.config.ts`.

Portfolio Project – Agent Notes
Context

This project is my first personal React project, created with the goal of building a simple, professional, and easily maintainable personal portfolio, without unnecessary complexity or deployment friction.

The main focus is:

Learning React fundamentals in a real project

Keeping the stack minimal and beginner-friendly

Ensuring easy deployment to GitHub Pages

Having a solid base to iterate and improve over time

Technical Decisions
Stack Choice

React + Vite

Chosen for fast setup, simple configuration, and modern defaults

Tailwind CSS

Utility-first styling for speed, consistency, and easy animations

Single Page Application (SPA) – no routing

No React Router

Navigation via anchor links and scroll

Avoids GitHub Pages routing issues (404 on refresh)

This approach minimizes configuration overhead and removes common deployment pitfalls for first-time React projects.

Design & UX Principles

Dark theme by default

Clean, modern, “tech-oriented” aesthetic

Fully responsive (mobile-first)

Subtle animations using Tailwind utilities:

Hover effects (scale, shadow, lift)

Entrance animations on scroll (fade / translate)

Focus on readability, contrast, and visual hierarchy

Content Structure
Header / Hero

Profile image (placeholder for now: avatar / caricature / photo)

Name and role (placeholders)

Short background / education summary (2–4 lines)

Primary CTAs:

View Cases (scroll)

Contact (scroll)

Optional CV download (placeholder)

Portfolio Cases

Data-driven from a local file (src/data/cases.ts)

Each case includes:

Cover image (required)

Title and summary

Stack and tags

Highlights and metrics (when applicable)

Optional links (GitHub, demo, article)

Cases displayed as cards in a responsive grid

Clicking a case opens a modal with full details (no routing)

Additional Sections

About (short bio + experience timeline)

Skills / Stack (grouped badges)

Contact (form + social links)

Footer

Data Management

Portfolio content is not hardcoded in components

All cases are stored in a structured local data file:

Easy to add, remove, or update projects

Acts as a simple “developer CMS”

Development Workflow
1. Layout & Code Generation

Initial layout and structure generated using Lovable (free version)

Lovable used strictly as a code generator, not as a hosting or runtime environment

Requested full project output as a file tree with complete file contents

2. Local Project Setup

Local Vite + React project created

All files generated by Lovable were copied and overwritten manually

No files were auto-generated locally beyond the initial Vite setup

3. Dependency Installation

Dependencies installed directly from the package.json provided by Lovable:

npm install

4. Local Development

Project executed locally using:

npm run dev


Validation step before any refactoring or optimization

5. Post-Generation Improvements

After the project runs successfully, the codebase is refined using Codex CLI:

Cleanup and refactoring

Component organization

Animation improvements

Accessibility adjustments

GitHub Pages deployment preparation

Deployment Strategy

Target platform: GitHub Pages

Static build via Vite

SPA without routing eliminates the need for 404 redirects

Vite base configuration adjusted depending on repository name

Guiding Principles

Make it work first

Improve incrementally

Avoid overengineering

Favor clarity over cleverness

Treat this project as both a portfolio and a learning artifact
